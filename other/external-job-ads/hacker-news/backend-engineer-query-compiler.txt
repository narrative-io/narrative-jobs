Narrative I/O | Senior/Staff Backend Engineer - Query Compiler | New York, NY | Full-time | REMOTE | $140k to $200k USD | https://narrative.io/

Narrative has been building a data collaboration platform designed for simplicity and ease of use since being founded in 2016.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by:

- Automatically standardizing data, simplifying the user experience by eliminating the need to deal with n representations of the same underlying concept from different suppliers.

- Making platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL) and easy-to-use UIs powered by NQL. This enables users to transform, deduplicate, and filter data instead of selecting from a set of provider-defined, pre-packaged datasets.

- Giving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies for their data.

We are a small, remote-first team looking for someone with experience working on query compilers or query execution systems in general. While the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu√©bec), Poland, and Serbia.

In brief, the technologies we use are:

- Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers. We love functional programming and make use of libraries like Cats, Cats-Effect, and FS2, but we keep a pragmatic stance on purity given our exposure to the Spark ecosystem.

- Our services are deployed on AWS and provisioned using Terraform. We leverage the usual suspects: Fargate, EMR, RDS, Lambda, etc. and we're starting to lean into Kubernetes. Being a small team, we think twice before rolling out custom infrastructure that we'll need to monitor and maintain.

- On the frontend, we use Typescript, VueJS, PrimeVue, Nuxt, and Vite.
