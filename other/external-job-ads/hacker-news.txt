Narrative I/O | Scala/AWS/Spark Backend Engineer, VueJS Frontend Engineer| New York, NY | Full-time | ONSITE, REMOTE | http://narrative.io/

Narrative is building a data streaming marketplace that makes it easy to buy, sell and win. 

We do this by creating tools that reduce the friction and increase transparency in the data buying process, creating a win-win relationship between buyers and sellers.

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.

We are building the team with a remote-first mindset, and as a result every team member is expected to have an ability to synthesize business requirements, distill the domain, contribute to high-level design documents, efficiently communicate asynchronously, and more generally work autonomously toward a shared vision.

While the company's headquarter is in NYC, the development team is currently made of engineers working from California (US), Québec (Canada), New Brunswick (Canada) and British Columbia (Canada).

Our technical stack (Scala, AWS, Spark on the backend, VueJS on the frontend) looks like:

- Our webapp frontend projects are written in Vuejs, Sass and Pug. We make use of modern and fuctional JavaScript patterns.

- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum. We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, cats-effect, http4s, doobie, but keep a pragmatic stance on purity and are also exposed to the AWS Java SDK/hadoop/spark ecosystems.

- We are operating in Amazon Web Services. Our long-running services are deployed on EC2, Fargate, and Lambda and provisioned with Terraform. Our scheduled (spark) jobs are mostly executing on EMR and triggered by Jenkins Jobs.

- We also heavily use other AWS technologies such as DynamoDB, S3, RDS, Step Functions and EMR.

- Other services we use include: GitHub, Gitlab, Jenkins, DataDog, Crucible.

- Being a small team, we think twice before rolling out custom infra that we need to monitor and maintain.
