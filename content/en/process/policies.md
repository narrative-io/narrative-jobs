## Equal Opportunity Employment

Narrative is an Equal Opportunity Employer. The company supports diversity and inclusion in its core values and does not
discriminate against qualified employees or applicants because of race, color, religion, gender identity, sex, sexual
preference, sexual identity, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, marital status, physical
disability, mental disability, medical condition, military status, religion, or any other characteristic protected by
federal or state law or local ordinance. When necessary, the company will reasonably accommodate employees and
applicants with disabilities if the person is otherwise qualified to safely perform all of the essential functions of
the position.

## Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to community members and Narrative team members in all Narrative communities online
(including but not limited Twitter and Facebook), in the Narrative office, and at all events hosted by Narrative.

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity,
nationality, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation
involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or
mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political
affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality,
physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing. Consider that calling attention to differences can
feel alienating.

We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography
or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by
anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to
those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating these
rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [Nick](mailto:nick@narrative.io) or one of the other founders
immediately.

## Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy

Narrative is committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery and corruption. Therefore, it
is Narrativeâ€™s policy to conduct all aspects of its business in an honest and ethical manner at all times. This policy
applies to all individuals working for Narrative, including anyone providing services to Narrative, such as consultants
or contractors.

### Objective

The aim of this policy is to help Narrative observe and uphold our zero-tolerance position on bribery and corruption.

### Coverage

This policy applies to all permanent and fixed-term staff employed by Narrative and any contractors, consultants or
other persons acting under or on behalf of Narrative.

### Principles

Narrative and its staff will not:

* Make contributions of any kind with the purpose of gaining any commercial advantage.
* Provide gifts or hospitality with the intention of persuading anyone to act improperly, or to influence a public
  official in the performance of their duties.
* Make, or accept, 'kickbacks' of any kind.

Narrative will:

* Keep appropriate internal records that will evidence the business reason for making any payments to third parties.
* Encourage employees to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of malpractice at the earliest possible stage.
* See that anyone raising a concern about bribery will not suffer any detriment as a result, even if that person turns
  out to be mistaken.
* Allow alleged instances of corruption and bribery to be submitted confidentially.

### Reporting

Employees are encouraged to submit any alleged instances of corruption directly to our CEO (nick@narrative.io).  If
confidentiality is required we recommend setting up a ProtonMail account and not passing any identifying information in
the submission.  All submissions will be handled with rigor.
