Narrative has been building a data collaboration platform designed for simplicity and ease of use since being founded in 2016.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by:

- Automatically [standardizing data](https://kb.narrative.io/how-rosetta-stone-works), simplifying the user experience by eliminating the need to deal with `n` representations of the same underlying concept from different suppliers.
- Making platform data accessible through the [Narrative Query Language (NQL)](https://kb.narrative.io/narrative-sql-nql-overview) and easy-to-use UIs powered by NQL. This enables users to transform, deduplicate, and filter data instead of selecting from a set of provider-defined, pre-packaged datasets.
- Giving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies for their data.

The same building blocks powering our marketplace enable other data collaboration use cases, like clean room data analysis and automatic segmentation of data with delivery to platforms like The TradeDesk and Yahoo!. We're also building towards a future where users can leverage our collaboration tools without needing their data to reside on our platform; instead, our query engine will be embeddable where their data is already at rest.
