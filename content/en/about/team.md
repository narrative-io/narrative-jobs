## The Team

We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing
features from design to launch.

We are building the team with a remote-first mindset, and as a result every team member is expected to have an ability
to synthesize business requirements, distill the domain, contribute to high-level design documents, efficiently
communicate asynchronously, and more generally work autonomously toward a shared vision.

While the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team is currently made of engineers working from the US
(California and Florida), Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu√©bec), Germany, and Nigera.
