## The Team

We are a small looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from
design to launch.

We are building the team with a remote-first mindset, and as a result everyone is expected to have the ability
to synthesize business requirements, distill the domain, contribute to high-level design documents, efficiently
communicate asynchronously, and more generally work autonomously toward a shared vision.

While the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from
the US (California, Colorado, and New York), Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu√©bec), Poland, and Serbia.
