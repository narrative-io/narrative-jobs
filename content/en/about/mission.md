## Mission Statement

Narrative is the worldâ€™s leading data collaboration platform that enables organizations to supercharge their data
strategy with one powerful, cost-effective suite of tools that anyone can use.

Unlike other data solutions, Narrative's data collaboration platform is focused on fundamental principles that make
collaboration easier, safer, and more strategic.

### Autonomy

Narrative believes that you should own your data strategy and you should have the tools to operate that strategy on your
own terms. Our software lets you create custom strategies based on what is best for your business. Define custom data
sets, set your own price, and pick your own partners. 100% end-to-end control.

### Privacy & Compliance

Compliance and privacy need to be at the forefront of any data strategy. Narrative empowers our customers to be
diligent, compliant, and nimble in a quickly evolving environment. We provide transparency, control, and tools that make
it possible for your organization to leverage data without incurring undue risk.

### Data Quality

The value you get out of the data is only as good as its quality. Our data collaboration platform gives you the features
that make it easy to find and validate high-quality data no matter your use case.

### Liquidity

Easy access to both buyers or sellers removes the step of having to source them yourself. Narrative operates a data
marketplace that provides both sides with instant opportunities without giving up visibility or control.

### Transparency

Efficient markets are those where all of the participants have perfect visibility. Our platform allows for buyers and
sellers to have full line of site into who the participants are and the mechanics of the entire Narrative ecosystem.
