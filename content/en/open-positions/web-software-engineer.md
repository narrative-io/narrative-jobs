## What You Will Do

Here's what you will do in a nutshell:

- Create new features for Narrative's `Vuejs` web application. Work with Product and Design teams to create the best user experience and create modular, maintainable components.
- Design, implement and maintain embedded applications on Narrative's Data Marketplace which enhance the ability of customers to manage and manipulate data. 
- Dig into Scala and create new API endpoints to serve the frontend applications. 
- Help select technologies and define the strategic direction for our system architecture
- Work on Narrative's Tacklebox UI library, designing creating reusable components and modules for use in all of Narrative's web applications.
- Review and evaluate team members' code contibutions, delivering transparent, honest and direct feedback to your peers. 

While most of the work focuses on the frontend, this position is ideal for someone who would like to improve his/her backend and Functional Programming skills.

## Technical Stack

## The Ideal Candidate

We are not looking for a 100% fit on all the technology buzzwords, but we are looking for someone with strong personal and technical
skills who is eager to pick up new technologies as necessary. We are obviously going to expect much more from a senior candidate than we 
would from a junior one.

The ideal candidate should:

- Have extensive experience in one or more web frameworks (`Vue`, `React`, `Angular` etc.) and the `ES6`/`JavaScript`/`HTML`/`CSS` ecosystem.
- Have proven experience using `Amazon Web Services` to deploy and host web applications and databases.
- Be able to debug various aspects of web application code, such as cross-browser Javascript quirks.
- Thoroughly understand the HTTP lifecycle and how the browser interacts with web APIs.
- Enjoy building fast, user-friendly UIs.
- Not be afraid of contributing to the entire stack when the need arises, given that frontend doesnâ€™t simply mean `HTML`/`CSS`.
  For instance, a feature might require
  - some metrics to be computed from a `Spark` Report
  - creating a `PostgreSQL` migration script
  - tweaking `S3` permissions and `terraform` scripts for deployment
