## What You Will Do

We currently have a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of adtech data, and we are building on this success 
to make it possible to transact any other kinds of data.

As a result, here are the kinds of projects you will likely work on in the foreseable future:
- Make our core systems generic/agnostic to the actual data types that are being ingested, transacted and delivered. 
  For instance, we are building Iceberg-backed data puddles, schema/validation tools, making the transaction process more generic, etc.
- Improve the monitoring and reliability of our systems with the ever-increasing amount of data being handled (over 500GB per day)
- Extract abstractions, modularize the code and improve the tests.
- Enhance the API we expose to partners and increasingly rely on it for internal use, in order to "eat our own dogfood".


## Technical Stack

## The Ideal Candidate

We are not looking for a 100% fit on all the technology buzzwords, but we are looking for someone with strong personal and technical
skills who is eager to pick up new technologies as necessary. We are obviously going to expect much more from a senior candidate than we 
would from a junior one.

The ideal candidate should:
- Have experience in a typed functional language such as Scala, F# or Haskell, or significant experience in their non-functional
  equivalents (Java, C#) with an interest in Scala and Functional Programming.
- Have experience working with non-trivial quantities of data.  As of this writing, our ingestion pipelines are handling
  something on the order of 500GB .snappy.parquet files per day.  Prior work with Spark would be ideal, but experience
  with similar MapReduce-based technologies would also be helpful.
- Have experience operating in a cloud environment like Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, or similar.
- Be able to work across all aspects of back end systems, from application code to SQL to systems administration.
- Not be afraid of contributing to the entire stack (from the UI to Devops) when the need arises.
