## What You Will Do

We have built a marketplace that allows buyers and sellers to transact any kind of data.

Here are the kinds of projects you will likely work on:

- Add capabilities to our query execution and data classification engines to make it possible to fulfill any buyer
  query.
- Iterate on our forecasting system so that buyers get faster, more accurate insights into the volume and quality of
  data they are purchasing.
- Build out additional connectors to make it effortless to get data into and out of our marketplace.
- Design a framework for metering resource usage by partner (e.g. storage, server hours, API calls) and integrate it
  into billing.
- Improve query planning, optimization, and batching to make sure our transaction jobs are running efficiently.
- Help buyers and sellers build data workflows on the platform. E.g. enabling buyers use the output of one of their
  purchases as an input filter to another purchase.
- Automate table maintenance tasks like file compaction, data retention, choosing partitioning and sort strategies based
  on statistics gathered about a dataset and historical query patterns, etc.
- Architect service interfaces and composable subsystems as we scale the team and decompose our monolith.
- Improve the monitoring and reliability of our systems with the ever-increasing amount of data being handled: currently
  we're ingesting > 10 TB of data from sellers every day.
- Extract abstractions, modularize the code, and improve tests.

## Technical Stack

## The Ideal Candidate

We are not looking for a 100% fit on all the technology buzzwords, but we are looking for someone with strong personal
and technical skills who is eager to pick up new technologies as necessary.

The ideal candidate should:

- Have experience in a typed functional language such as Scala, F#, or Haskell, or significant experience in their
  non-functional equivalents (Java, C#) with an interest in Scala and Functional Programming.
- Have experience working with non-trivial quantities of data. Prior experience with Spark would be ideal, but
  experience with any distributed query engine (Trino, Dremio, etc.) would also be helpful.
- Have experience operating in a cloud environment like Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, or similar.
- Be able to work across all aspects of backend systems, from application code to SQL to systems administration.
- Not be afraid of contributing to the entire stack (from the UI to Devops) when the need arises.
