## Background

Narrative is a Data Collaboration Platform built for the AI era. We're solving one of the biggest challenges in AI and data science: how organizations can safely and efficiently share, discover, and collaborate on the data that powers intelligent systems. Our platform enables companies to break down data silos, accelerate AI initiatives, and unlock insights that weren't possible when working in isolation. We're working with some of the most innovative companies in the world who are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data and AI.

We're looking for a technical PM who enjoys getting their hands dirty and figuring things out. We're seeking someone who is excited about drafting product specs, building prototypes, testing releases, engaging directly with customers, and working closely with stakeholders including Engineering, Sales, and Solutions Engineering to solve hard problems with wide latitude.

## Responsibilities

- Engage directly with our biggest customers to understand what they need and get it done.
- Write detailed product specs and partner directly with Engineering to build products, test releases, and help train the go to market team.
- Build prototypes and dashboards when we need to validate ideas quickly (or just get something functioning).
- Make prioritization calls with limited resourcesâ€”balancing what customers are asking for vs. improving our platform vs. tackling technical debt.
- Partner closely with engineering on technical decisions and architecture discussions.

## Ideal Qualifications

- 3+ years of experience in technical product management, ideally B2B/enterprise, and you've shipped complex features at smaller companies before.
- You've engaged directly with customers on technical implementations and enjoy those conversations.
- You're energized by ambiguity and shifting priorities: you like getting things done in an unstable world.
- You have experience with SQL and have worked with data pipelines, APIs, and cloud products and platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, and Snowflake/Databricks.

## Why You Will Love This Job

- Lots of autonomy and room to make decisions that matter immediately.
- Direct access to customers so you can see the impact of your work right away.
- You'll be working with a very talented, technical team who care about building things well and solving interesting problems.
