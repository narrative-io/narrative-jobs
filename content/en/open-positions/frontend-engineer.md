## Background

Narrative has been building a data collaboration platform designed for simplicity and ease of use since being founded
in 2016.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by:

- Automatically [standardizing data](https://kb.narrative.io/how-rosetta-stone-works), simplifying the user experience
  by eliminating the need to deal with `n` representations of the same underlying concept from different suppliers.

- Making platform data accessible through
  the [Narrative Query Language (NQL)](https://kb.narrative.io/narrative-sql-nql-overview) and easy-to-use UIs powered
  by NQL. This enables users to transform, deduplicate, and filter data instead of selecting from a set of
  provider-defined, pre-packaged datasets.

- Giving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies for their data.

Our customers primarily interface with our platform using a user-friendly, NQL-optional UI designed to make performing
technical tasks, like managing datasets and connecting data to multiple destination, easy for non-technical users.

## What You Will Do

Youâ€™ll set the UI standards for a modern data platform by designing systems, interaction models, and tooling that make powerful capabilities feel simple and safe to use.

### Example Projects

- Build a system that starts with structured representations of NQL queries from our API and turns them into intuitive front-end experiences. This system will make it possible to present complex queries in a clear, user-friendly way, enabling non-technical users to interact with the full depth of our data infrastructure without needing to involve themselves with the complexities of a query language.

- Help architect and refine our new Audience Studio a streamlined UI that lets users easily define audiences from their data through simplified filtering and deduplication logic to connect them to various destinations.

- Design and implement the front-end architecture for Narrative's Connector Framework, a system that will standardize how new third-party Connector applications are added to our platform. This framework eliminates the need for one-off custom integrations by providing a consistent, scalable way to expand our Connector Library.

- Transform our prototype identity graph UI into a production-ready system that pushes the boundaries of data unification. You'll work on experiences that allow users to customize their entity resolution rules, visualize how different rules result in different connected components, and train classification models by providing feedback on match quality.

## Technical Stack

Our frontend is written in Typescript using VueJs, Nuxt, and Vite, and deployed via CloudflarePages.

## Ideal Candidate

The ideal candidate should:

- Have strong experience with modern JavaScript frameworks (Vue 3/Nuxt preferred) and TypeScript, with a focus on component-based architecture and reusable UI patterns. Expert in modern, functional JavaScript patterns.
- Proficient working in complex, data-heavy codebases, including advanced data transformation, API integration, and state management across large projects.
- Have experience operating in cloud-based environments and are comforable improving and shaping our CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies, and Git-based workflows.
- Have proven experience working in environments where unit and functional component testing are standard practice, consistently producing maintainable and reliable code backed by strong test coverage.
